# Binary-Classification-SemiAutoML-Web-App
Machine Learning Web App built using Python and streamlit

Website link: https://binary-classification-web-app.herokuapp.com


This Web App allows you to choose from among three types of classifiers by changing the hyperparameters as you like. You can multiselect three metrics for evalutation. You can upload your own data to perform binary classification on it.
